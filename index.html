    <p>The purpose of this website is to guide and provide a possible solution to the
up-coming and current grade 11 students.</p>
<p>This module contains the challenges that the TVL-CSS students at San Guillermo Integrated School and the possible solution that can also help you. Below are the lists of the challenges that have been encountered by the TVL-CSS students at San Guillermo Integrated School. </p>
<p>The challenges students encountered in their specialized subject was the inadequate equipment used for hands-on activities. A lack of supplies and dilapidated facilities are just a few of the problems encountered by students that seriously hinder their capacity to learn.</p> 
<h2><li>Lack of Equipments</li></h2>
(explanation)
<br>
<h2><li>Internet</li></h2>

<p>The Internet is a vast network that connects computers all over the world. Through the Internet, people can share information and communicate from anywhere with an Internet connection.</p>

<p>An ESD mat – also called an antistatic mat – is a covering that shields an individual or a piece of equipment from static electricity discharge. These mats come in a variety of sizes and are typically placed on the floor or a workstation surface.</p> 
<p>The possible solution here is you can use wrist trap you clip the alligator on the metal part of the unit system before cleaning, disassembling, and assembling.</p>
<br>
<h2><li>Tweezers</li></h2>

<p>a small instrument that is used like pincers in grasping or pulling something.</p>
<p>If you don't have tweezers, seek around your house for natural alternatives. A pair of angled brow scissors, disinfected nail clippers, or even the edge of a credit card can do the trick.</p>
<br>
<h2><li>RJ45</li></h2>

<p>RJ45 connectors are most commonly used to connect one internet-enabled device with another network device. For example, a PC connected to a server, router, modem, smart TV, gaming console, or any device utilizing Ethernet protocol.</p>
<p>If there is no rj45 in your school you need to buy or provide by yourself for when you need and there is a similar LAN cable.</p>
<br>
<h2><li>Compressed Air</li></h2>
<img src="Compressed Air.png" alt=""width= 300px height="250px">
<p>Compressed air works by creating a high-velocity air flow that can dislodge and remove dust and dirt from the surface of your computer hardware. </p>
<p>If you don't have compressed air, you can use the balloon, fill it with air and point it at the dirty part and use it, and you can also use the balloon pump to remove dust and other dirt from the equipment.</p>
<br>
<h2><li>Lint Free Cloth</li></h2>
<img src="Lint Cloth.png" alt="Lint Cloth" width="300px" height="250px">
<p>A lint free or low lint product, such as a lint free cloth or lint free wipes, is designed to minimize the shedding of fibres or particles during use.</p>
<p>if you don't have a lint free cloth, you can use another wipe with a soft cloth so as not to damage the monitor and wipe with it.</p>
