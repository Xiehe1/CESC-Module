<p>
    Personal core values of community action initiatives are guiding principles that
dictate moral ethics and guide us on how we think, feel and behave. They allow us in
shaping a better way of living. The environment we are in and our own experiences
are part in shaping what we truly value in life especially those we love the most.

    In conclusion, core values serves as the way to idenfity where community we belong to.
This will contains the belief, social norms, and dictate our behavior. They guide us with 
what we feel and, think, as well as how we behave.
